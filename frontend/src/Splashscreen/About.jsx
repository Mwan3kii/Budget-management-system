          <p>I am a full-stack software engineering student at ALX specializing in front-end and back-end web development.
                      With expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, MySQL, React and Node.js. I craft intuitive and engaging user
                      interfaces that bring digital experiences to life.
                      Finding creative solutions to problems and learning new things are things that I have always enjoyed,
                      so I'm passionate about building software that improves the lives of those around me.
                      Therefore, I develop application that could help people in our community to enable a better living.</p>
